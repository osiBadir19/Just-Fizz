Hi everyone! My name is Osi and I'm 20 years old. I'm a beginner programmer and I'm excited to share my journey with all of you. I'm looking forward to learning and growing my programming skills, and I'm sure that this community will be a great help to me. I'm sure I'm going to have a lot of fun along the way!

*In this mission, you receive a positive integer and return:*

- *"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9 ...)*
- *otherwise convert the given number to a string (2 -> "2").*


***Input**: An Integer.*

***Output**: A String.*

Examples:

1. assert checkio(15) == "Fizz"
2. assert checkio(6) == "Fizz"
3. assert checkio(10) == "10"
4. assert checkio(7) == "7"
